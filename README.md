===== Notes to Consider =====
* Project could be improve by using combination of mousedown and mousehover to allow more precision when sketching instead of just hover.
* Project could be improved by using the color picker to display the current color at all stages. 
* Could add tool the increase the size of grid container.
* Could also consider updating the UI and CSS to further stylize the project to be more appealing.
